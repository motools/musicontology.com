      <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
      <p>
        This page aims at providing answers to the most frequently asked questions around the Music Ontology
        and its use.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the Music Ontology?</h2>
      <p>
        The Music Ontology provides a vocabulary for publishing and linking a wide range of music-related data on the Web.
        Music Ontology data can be published by anyone as part of a web site or an API and linked with existing data, therefore
        creating a music-related <a href="http://linkeddata.org">web of data</a>. 
      </p>

      <h2>Why using the Music Ontology?</h2>
      <p>
        The Music Ontology provides a useful framework in the following cases:
        <ul>
          <li>Building a music website <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/BBC/">that's also an API</a>.</li>
          <li>Opening up music-related data whilst ensuring it can be used alongside other sources.</li>
          <li>Integrating music-related data across multiple sources.</li>
          <li>Enriching search-engine results around tracks, artists, musical works etc.</li>
          <li>Designing a music-related database schema or domain model.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>What technologies is it using?</h2>
      <p>
        The Music Ontology is built on <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, a technology developed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>.
        RDF enables data to be described as "triples": subject, predicate and object, i.e. "this track" "is part of" "this album". RDF
        can be serialized in a number of ways, as shown in our <a href="getting-started.html">examples</a>.
        The Music Ontology is specified using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a>, which provides a set of constructs
        to describe domain models in RDF.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is the Music Ontology based on RDF?</h2>
      <p>
        It would be very difficult to tackle the many competing requirements of the music domain with a stand-alone format.
        By using RDF, the Music Ontology gains a powerful extensibility mechanism, allowing Music-Ontology-based 
        data to be mixed with claims made in any other RDF vocabulary. Instead of covering all music-related topics 
        within the Music Ontology itself, we describe the basic topics and build into a larger 
        framework - RDF - that allows us to take advantage of work elsewhere on more specific description vocabularies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various available RDF serializations also enables the Music Ontology to tackle a number of use-cases, e.g.
        <a href="http://rdfa.info">RDFa</a> to embed music data in web pages, <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a>
        to provide such data as part of an API, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/01/Turtle/Trig">TriG</a> for easily
        exchanging large databases of music information.
      </p>

      <h2>How expressive is the Music Ontology?</h2>
      <p>
        The Music Ontology can express a wide range of music-related information, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>"A particular arrangement of the Trout Quintet by Franz Schubert was interpreted in this performance."</li>
          <li>"This work was performed ten times, but only two of these performances were recorded."</li>
          <li>"Ten takes of this particular track have been recorded, each of which with a particular microphone location."</li>
          <li>"Come as You Are" by Nirvana was released on a single and the "Nevermind" album."</li>
          <li>"During this gig, the band played ten songs. During the last one (a cover of "Eight days a week"), 
the drummer from the support band joined them to play with them."</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Many extensions are available as well, for example to describe the audio content itself 
      (the <a href="http://www.omras2.org/AudioFeatures">Audio Features ontology</a>)
      or recording sessions (the <a href="http://isophonics.net/content/studio-ontology">Studio ontology</a>).</p>

      <h2>How to contribute or ask questions?</h2>
      <p>
        The specification process is community-driven, with discussions
        happening on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/music-ontology-specification-group">our mailing list</a>
        and development happening on <a href="https://github.com/motools">our Github account</a>.
